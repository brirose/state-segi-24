-input treatment data
-union to create independent treatment+disturbance history polygons



#Input and clean treatment data


```{r input_data}
treatment <- read_sf()#add treatment data

fire <- read_sf() #CBI

groves <- read_sf() #grove data

```

reminder: do both with buffer and without; need to decide if doing donut or all and subtracting after
```{r buffer}

#buffer groves
groves_buffered <- 

#clip treatment to area of interest
treatment_clipped <- st_intersection(treament, groves_buffered)

#clip fire to area of interest
fire_clipped <- st_intersection(fire, groves_buffered)

```



```{r create_union}

#create layer of individual polygons for each fire history
fire_history <- st_union(fire_clipped, by_feature = T)

#create layer of individual polygons for each treatment history
fire_history <- st_union(treatment_clipped, by_feature = T)

#create layer of individual polygons for each fire history/treatment history
resistance_polyons <- st_union(fire_history, treatment_history, by_feature = T)

```
